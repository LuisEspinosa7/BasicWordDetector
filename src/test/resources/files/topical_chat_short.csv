1, Yeah, cats can be cool, but they sure do spend a lot of their time sleeping.

3, Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.
3, i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life
3, Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex.
3, thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced
3, Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it.
3, say what now?? they have that??
3, Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!
3, thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!
3, Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.
3, i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?
3, That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.
3, i guess they live up to their name then!
3, It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.
3, thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis? 
3, Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth's.
3, seems like fresh water fish got the short end of the stick with that one. Have you ever been to a cat cafe?
3, I have never been to a cat cafe no, what about you? Seems like they are popular in Japan and Taiwan.
3, no but I would love to! paying hourly to hang out with adorable cats? im in!
3, Yeah that would be a lot of fun. I didn't realize that cats sleep so much. Must be nice.
3, i guess thats where the phrase cat nap comes from
3, Oh yeah I guess so ha ha. There's even a town in Alaska that has a mayor cat.
4, Hi!  do you like to dance?
4, I love to dance a lot. How about you?
4, I am really bad, but it is a good time.
4, Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?
4, I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything!
4, Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.
4, I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!
4, Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?
4, Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.
4, Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper. 
4, He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.
4, I didn't know this thanks for sharing.
4, Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes?
4, No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind.
4, There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves.
4, Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it.
4, Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.
4, I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week.
4, That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them.
4, No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this.
4, It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.
4, Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye
4, Bye
